# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using **content-based filtering** and basic **machine learning** techniques in Python. The system recommends movies based on their similarity to a movie selected by the user. It uses metadata like genres and movie titles to compute similarity scores between different movies.

## Features

- Content-based filtering using movie metadata (title, genres)
- TF-IDF Vectorization to represent movie data as feature vectors
- Cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies
- Recommend similar movies based on a selected movie

## Dataset

The project uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) which provides metadata of thousands of movies including titles, genres, and user ratings. You can download the dataset from Kaggle or the official MovieLens website.

### Files used:
- **movies.csv**: Contains movie information such as movie titles and genres
- **ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings (not used directly in this version but could be used for collaborative filtering)

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The movie titles and genres are combined into a single string of metadata. 
2. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF Vectorization, the text data is converted into numerical feature vectors.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: The similarity between two movies is computed using the cosine of the angle between their feature vectors.
4. **Recommendations**: The system suggests movies that are most similar to the movie selected by the user.

## Project Structure

```bash
.
├── movies.csv             # Movie dataset
├── ratings.csv            # User ratings dataset (optional)
├── recommendation.py      # Main Python script to run the recommendation system
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt       # Python package dependencies
```

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the recommendation system:
   ```bash
   python recommendation.py
   ```

4. Input a movie title and get recommendations:
   ```python
   get_recommendations('The Dark Knight')
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more metadata such as directors, cast, and release years.
- Add collaborative filtering methods to improve recommendations.
- Create a web app or UI to interact with the recommendation system.
- Use advanced deep learning models for better accuracy.
